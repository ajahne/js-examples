# Closure Examples

## Examples
Each folder represents practical examples of closure.

## Definition
Technical definition: A function that retains access to the lexical scope.  
Practical definition: An inner function defined within an outer function that retains access to the scope (i.e. variables) of the outer function after the outer function has returned.  
A closure is created every time a function is created.
